            Please review this pull request and provide feedback on:
            - Breaking changes, if any
            - Style and conventions
            - New quantities or units
              - See `.claude/pr-review-instructions.md` for guidance and criteria, they should be widely used and well defined
              - If it seems domain specific or obscure we ask for justification and use cases
            - Changes to generated code
              - Focus feedback on changes to code generators
              - Tie feedback to specific examples from generated code to explain, try to pick 1-3 quantities of different types, e.g. `Length` (`ILinearQuantity`), `Temperature` (`IAffineQuantity`) and `Level` (`ILogarithmicQuantity`)
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Test coverage
            - Security concerns, but only if medium or higher severity
