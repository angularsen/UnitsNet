//     See https://github.com/angularsen/UnitsNet/wiki/Adding-a-New-Unit for how to add or edit units.
//
//     Add CustomCode\Quantities\MyUnit.extra.cs files to add code to generated quantities.
//     Add Extensions\MyUnitExtensions.cs to decorate quantities with new behavior.
//     Add UnitDefinitions\MyUnit.json and run GeneratUnits.bat to generate new units or quantities.
